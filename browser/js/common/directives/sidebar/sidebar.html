	<h2>How to Play</h2>
	<p>This game is a remake of a game called 'No Thanks!' by Thorsten Gimmler. The goal of the game is to have the fewest points. The value of each card is how many points it is worth. Each coin is worth -1 point.</p>
	<p>One card will be shown to all players. On each player's turn, they must decide to either:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Accept the card; the value of the card will be added to the player's points.</li>
		<li>Decline the card; one of the player's coins will be added to the card.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If the player accepts the card, they player must then decide again for the next card. When the player declines a card, it is the next player's turn.</p>
	<p>The next player faces the same decision: Accept the card (and all the coins on it), or decline it and pay one coin. If a player has no coins on their turn, they are forced to take the card.</p>
	<p>Players can see each other's cards, but each player's coins are hidden. The game ends when the cards run out.</p>
	<h2>The Catch</h2>
	<p>Unbroken card sequences only count as the lowest number of the sequence.</p>
	<p>For example, if a player has both the 8 card and the 9 card, those two cards together only count as 8 points. If a player has the cards 17, 18, 19 and 20, all of them together only count as 17 points.</p>
	<p>However, at the beginning of the game, 9 random cards will be removed and the game is played with just 24 cards. No player will know which cards are removed.</p>
	<h2>Scoring</h2>
	<p>Once all of the cards have been taken, each player's total points are calculated by adding up the values of all single cards, plus the value of the lowest card of each unbroken card sequence. For each coin the player has, 1 point is subtracted.</p>
	<p>The player with the fewest points is the winner.</p>
